# Attention

⚠️⚠️⚠️ Archived - This is the archive branch for the RSS3 Protocol from v0.1.0 to v0.4.0, please switch to [the main branch](https://github.com/RSS3-Network/RSS3-Protocol/tree/main) for the latest version.

It functions as a historical reference for the RSS3 Community's earlier efforts but may not provide an up-to-date perspective on the current state of the RSS3 Protocol or Network.

# RSS3 Protocol

RSS3 is an open information syndication protocol that aims to support efficient and decentralized information distribution in Web3.

We've seen the Web1 era when everyone was happy to use RSS as a standard format for syndication and the Web2 era when RSS declined and the closure of information between platforms was created.

We all agree that information should be more freely distributed in the Web3 era, and to facilitate this we need a common format that we can all use to syndicate information, reducing the cost of use and development. So we created a new protocol RSS3, RSS stands for a tribute to the history and 3 stands for Web3.
